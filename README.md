# Mixed-effects-model-for-Basketball


A user can specify a model in specify_model_file.py, where users can select what variables are to be considered to be fixed-effect variables and define the design matrix for both random-effects and fixed-effects. To run the algorithm, specify the file of interest in main_glmer_example.py and estimation parameters, such as the maximum number of it- eration, convergence threshold value, the number of parallel loops, number of samples, etc. After the specification of a model (defaults values are given, so do not need to specify parameters), one can run the file main_glmer_example.py. The function will return estimated parameters for fixed effects, estimated parameters for random effects, and covari- ance matrix estimates as well as training prediction resutls â€“ all in separate csv files.
